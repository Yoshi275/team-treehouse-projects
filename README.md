  diy-number-game - you have 5 guesses to guess the number the computer is thinking of  
    - start a game loop  
    - use user input to respond  
    - use python inbuilt functions like random  
    - import python library  
    
  reverse-number-game - you think of a number, and the computer has 5 guesses to get it right  
    - to improve guessing based on previous response  
    - to respond to user input and give feedback  
    - create game loop  
    
  word-game - classic hangman but automatic

    - clear screen using sys and os library  
    
  rock-paper-scissors - two-player rock/paper/scissors results generator

  dungeon-game - player attempts to escape, or is eaten by monster  
    - unpacking of tuples  
    - visual mapping using python functions  
    - clear screen function  
    - really long arduous practice on breaking problem codes down  
  password-generator - user requests for password, and can pick weak or strong ones  
    - strings are really fun and cool  
    - really utilises random.choice() and randrange functions  
  nyt-decoder - generates titles on New York Times' frontpage
